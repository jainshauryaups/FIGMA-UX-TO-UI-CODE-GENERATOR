# Figma to Angular AI Code Generator - POC

**Automatically generate production-ready Angular components from Figma designs using IBM Granite LLM**

**Time Savings:** 10 seconds vs 7 hours (140x faster)  
**ROI Potential:** $420,000/year

---

## 🚀 **Quick Start for Developers**

### **Generate a Component in 3 Steps:**

```bash
# 1. Generate from Figma
node generate-with-preview.mjs <FIGMA-FILE-KEY> <NODE-ID> <component-name>

# 2. Review preview → Type 'A' to accept

# 3. Test in browser
npm start
# Visit http://localhost:4200/<component-name>
```

**That's it!** Component is generated, validated, committed to Git, and ready to use.

## 🎬 **Example Workflow**

```bash
# 1. Get Figma node ID from URL:
# https://figma.com/design/0eg3UmbqMcZtym1x8sGtZX/file?node-id=255-2415
#                           ↑ FILE KEY            ↑ NODE ID

# 2. Generate component
node generate-with-preview.mjs 0eg3UmbqMcZtym1x8sGtZX 255-2415 user-profile

# 3. You'll see:
#    ✅ Figma fetched
#    ✅ Code generated  
#    ✅ CSS validated
#    ✅ Files opened in VSCode

# 4. Review and choose:
#    [A] Accept → Commits to Git automatically
#    [R] Regenerate → Try again with stricter CSS
#    [E] Edit manually → Keep in preview folder
#    [C] Cancel → Delete preview

# 5. If you typed 'A', it automatically:
#    ✅ Creates branch: feat/figma-user-profile
#    ✅ Moves files to src/app/components/user-profile/
#    ✅ Updates app.routes.ts
#    ✅ Commits with Figma metadata

# 6. Push to GitHub
git push origin feat/figma-user-profile

# 7. Create PR and you're done!
```

## ⚠️ **Common Issues**

### **CSS Validation Failed?**
- **Regenerate:** Type `R` - AI tries again with stricter enforcement
- **Manual Fix:** Type `E` - Fix 1-2 classes manually (takes 30 seconds)
- **Accept Anyway:** Type `A` - Fix later (not recommended)

### **Component Not Showing in Browser?**
- Check `app.routes.ts` has the import and route
- Restart dev server: `npm start`
- Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/<component-name>`

**See [DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md](DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) for complete troubleshooting**
