# How to View Mermaid Diagrams

## ✅ Your Diagrams Are Correct!

The Mermaid code in your README.md is **properly formatted**. You're seeing the raw code because you need to view it in a renderer that supports Mermaid.

## 🎯 How to See the Rendered Diagrams

### Option 1: GitHub (Recommended) ✅

1. **Push your changes to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Open your repository on GitHub:**
   ```
   https://github.com/jainshauryaups/FIGMA-UX-TO-UI-CODE-GENERATOR
   ```

3. **View the README.md** - Diagrams will render automatically! 🎉

### Option 2: VS Code Markdown Preview

1. **Open README.md in VS Code**
2. **Press:** `Ctrl + Shift + V` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + V` (Mac)
3. **Or:** Click the preview icon in the top right corner
4. **Note:** You may need the "Markdown Preview Mermaid Support" extension

### Option 3: Install VS Code Extension

```bash
# Search in VS Code Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)

by Matt Bierner
```

### Option 4: Online Mermaid Live Editor

1. Go to: https://mermaid.live/
2. Copy your Mermaid code
3. Paste into the editor
4. See instant preview!

## 📊 Your Current Diagrams

You have **5 Mermaid diagrams** in README.md:

1. ✅ **High-Level Architecture Overview** (Line 63)
2. ✅ **Detailed System Architecture** (Line 83)
3. ✅ **Complete Data Flow Pipeline** (Line 272)
4. ✅ **12-Step Pipeline Flow** (Line 296)
5. ✅ **Technology Stack & Integration** (Line 398)

All use proper syntax and will render beautifully on GitHub!

## 🎨 What You'll See When Rendered

Instead of:
```
graph LR
    A[Figma] --> B[Python]
```

You'll see:
```
┌────────┐         ┌────────┐
│ Figma  │────────▶│ Python │
└────────┘         └────────┘
```

With colors, arrows, and professional styling!

## 🚀 Next Steps

**Push to GitHub now to see the diagrams rendered:**

```bash
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Add Mermaid architecture diagrams"
git push origin main
```

Then visit your GitHub repository and enjoy the professional architecture diagrams! ✨

**Note:** The diagrams are **correctly formatted**. You just need to view them in a Mermaid-compatible renderer (GitHub being the best option).
