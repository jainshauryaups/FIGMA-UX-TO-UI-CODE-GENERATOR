# 🚀 FINAL STEP: Connect to GitHub and Push

## ✅ **What We've Done So Far**

Your local repository is ready:
- ✅ Main branch created with all POC files (125 files committed)
- ✅ Complete documentation (20+ markdown files)
- ✅ Working demo-component
- ✅ Generator scripts ready
- ✅ Branch workflow implemented

**Now we just need to push it to GitHub!**

---

## 📋 **Step-by-Step: Create GitHub Repo and Push**

### **Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub**

1. **Go to:** https://github.com/new
   *(Should already be open in your browser)*

2. **Fill in:**
   ```
   Repository name: poc
   Description: Figma to Angular AI Code Generator - POC  
   Visibility: ○ Public  or  ● Private (recommended for internal POC)
   
   ☐ Add a README file (DON'T CHECK - we have one)
   ☐ Add .gitignore (DON'T CHECK - we have one)  
   ☐ Choose a license (Optional)
   ```

3. **Click:** `Create repository` button (green button at bottom)

---

### **Step 2: Copy Repository URL**

After creating, GitHub shows you a page with:

```
Quick setup — if you've done this kind of thing before

https://github.com/shauryajainups/poc.git ← COPY THIS!
```

**YOUR URL WILL BE:**
```
https://github.com/shauryajainups/poc.git
```

---

### **Step 3: Connect Local Repo to GitHub**

**Run in PowerShell (in your project directory):**

```powershell
# Add GitHub as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/shauryajainups/poc.git

# Verify connection
git remote -v

# Should show:
# origin  https://github.com/shauryajainups/poc.git (fetch)
# origin  https://github.com/shauryajainups/poc.git (push)
```

---

### **Step 4: Push Main Branch to GitHub**

```powershell
# Push main branch (first time with -u flag)
git push -u origin main
```

**You'll be prompted for GitHub credentials:**
- Username: `shauryajainups`
- Password: Use **Personal Access Token** (not your GitHub password)

**Don't have a token? Create one:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Name: "POC Push Token"
4. Expiration: 30 days
5. Select scopes: ✅ repo (all repo permissions)
6. Click "Generate token"
7. **COPY the token** (you won't see it again!)
8. Use this token as your password when pushing

---

### **Step 5: Verify on GitHub**

After push succeeds, go to:
```
https://github.com/shauryajainups/poc
```

**You should see:**
- ✅ All 125 files
- ✅ 20+ documentation markdown files
- ✅ README.md displayed on homepage
- ✅ main branch (default)
- ✅ Initial commit message
- ✅ All folders (src/, public/, .preview/, etc.)

---

## 🌳 **Optional: Push Feature Branch Too**

If you want to show the branching workflow on GitHub:

```powershell
# Push the old demo-component feature branch
git checkout feat/figma-demo-component
git push -u origin feat/figma-demo-component

# Switch back to main
git checkout main
```

Now GitHub will show both branches!

---

## 🎯 **What Happens Next?**

### **For You:**
1. Share repo URL with team: `https://github.com/shauryajainups/poc`
2. Give team members access (Settings → Collaborators)
3. Show CTO the repository

### **For Developers:**

When they want to generate a component:

```powershell
# 1. Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/shauryajainups/poc.git
cd poc
npm install

# 2. Create .env with credentials
FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN=...
IBM_GRANITE_API_KEY=...

# 3. Generate component (auto-creates branch!)
node generate-with-preview.mjs <file-key> <node-id> <component-name>
# Type 'A' to accept

# 4. Push new branch
git push origin feat/figma-<component-name>

# 5. Create PR on GitHub
# Go to: https://github.com/shauryajainups/poc/pulls
# Click "New Pull Request"
```

---

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Issue: "remote origin already exists"**

```powershell
# Remove existing remote
git remote remove origin

# Add correct remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/shauryajainups/poc.git
```

### **Issue: "Authentication failed"**

You need a Personal Access Token (PAT), not your GitHub password.

**Create one:**
https://github.com/settings/tokens

Use the token as your password when Git asks.

### **Issue: "Permission denied"**

Make sure you own the repository or have write access.
Check: https://github.com/shauryajainups/poc/settings/access
