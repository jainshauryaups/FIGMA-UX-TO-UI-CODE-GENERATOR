# Markdown Rendering Fix - Complete

## ✅ Problem Solved

The README.md was displaying broken content because **ASCII art was not wrapped in code blocks**, causing Markdown parsers to try interpreting the box-drawing characters as formatting.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Issue 1: ASCII Art Breaking Markdown ❌ → ✅

**Before:**
```
   ┌─── STAGE 1: DATA ACQUISITION ───┐
   │  Text here                       │
   └──────────────────────────────────┘
```
This was **outside code blocks**, breaking Markdown rendering.

**After:**
````markdown
### Pipeline Execution Stages

```
   ┌─── STAGE 1: DATA ACQUISITION ───┐
   │  Text here                       │
   └──────────────────────────────────┘
```
````
Now **properly wrapped in code blocks** with a descriptive heading.

### Issue 2: Mermaid Diagrams Simplified

**Removed:**
- `<br/>` line breaks (GitHub doesn't support them well)
- Complex multi-line labels
- Spaces in subgraph names

**Result:**
- ✅ High-Level Architecture - Simple 7-node flow
- ✅ Detailed System Architecture - 4 subgraphs (Input/Processing/Validation/Output)
- ✅ Data Flow Pipeline - Linear flowchart
- ✅ 12-Step Pipeline - Sequential with decision loop
- ✅ Technology Stack - Simple tree structure

## 📊 Current Status

### ✅ All Fixed and Working

1. **ASCII Art Sections** - Wrapped in code blocks:
   - Pipeline Execution Stages (6 stages)
   - External Services Integration
   - Output Layer File Structure
   - Developer Experience Layer

2. **Mermaid Diagrams** - Simplified syntax:
   - All 5 diagrams now use GitHub-compatible syntax
   - Removed `<br/>` tags
   - Simplified node labels
   - Clean subgraph names

3. **Markdown Structure** - Clean and organized:
   - Proper heading hierarchy
   - Clear section separation
   - Professional formatting
