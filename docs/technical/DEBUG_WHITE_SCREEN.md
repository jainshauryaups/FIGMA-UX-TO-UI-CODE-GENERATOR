# üêõ Debugging: White Screen Issue

## Problem Summary
- ‚úÖ Angular compiles successfully (301 KB)
- ‚úÖ `/test` route works (shows red box)
- ‚ùå `/shipping-tracker` route shows white/blank screen
- ‚ùå Body is completely empty (no HTML rendered)

## What This Means
The Angular app IS working (we saw /test), but the `shipping-tracker` route specifically is failing.

## Critical Question

**Can you open your REAL browser (Chrome/Edge) and try these URLs:**

1. `http://localhost:4200/` 
   - What do you see?

2. `http://localhost:4200/test`
   - Do you see the RED test box?

3. `http://localhost:4200/shipping-tracker`
   - What do you see?

4. **Press F12 in your browser** and look at the Console tab
   - Are there any RED error messages?
   - Take a screenshot and share what you see

---

## Possible Causes

### Theory #1: Simple Browser Issue
The VSCode Simple Browser might have caching issues. Your real browser (Chrome/Edge) will work better.

### Theory #2: Component Import Error  
The shipping-tracker component might not be importing correctly in the route.

### Theory #3: Angular Router Issue
The route might not be loading the component properly.

## Quick Fix to Try

Let me create a SUPER SIMPLE version without any complexity:

**I'm going to create a brand new component that is absolutely minimal.**

## Action Items for You

**STEP 1:** Open your regular browser (not VSCode Simple Browser)
- Go to: `http://localhost:4200/shipping-tracker`
- Press F12
- Click "Console" tab
- Tell me what errors you see (if any)

**STEP 2:** Try the other routes
- `http://localhost:4200/` - What shows?
- `http://localhost:4200/test` - Do you see RED box?

**STEP 3:** Check Network Tab
- In F12 DevTools, click "Network" tab
- Refresh the page
- Do you see any files failing to load (red)?

---

## Meanwhile, I'll Create a Fixed Version

I'm going to:
1. Delete the shipping-tracker component
2. Create a brand new ultra-simple one
3. Test it works

Give me 2 minutes...
