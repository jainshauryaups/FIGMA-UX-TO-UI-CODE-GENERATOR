# Generated Angular Application

AI-generated components from Figma designs appear in this folder.

## Structure

- **src/app/components/** - Generated components
- **src/app/app.routes.ts** - Auto-updated by pipeline
- **src/styles.scss** - UPS Brand CSS (53 approved classes)

## Running the App

```bash
cd generated-app
npm install
npm start
```

App runs at: http://localhost:4200

## How It Works

1. Run generator in ../pipeline/
2. Preview component in .preview/
3. Type 'A' to approve
4. Component moves here automatically
5. Route added to app.routes.ts
6. Git branch created (feat/figma-*)

See ../docs/guides/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md for the complete workflow.
